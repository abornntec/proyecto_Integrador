Use Amazon SNS or Amazon SQS for message queues if there\\'s any need for asynchronous processing.\\n\\n  2. **Justification:**\\n     Based on the context provided, we aim to create a serverless application with fast response times. The context mentions the importance of performance efficiency and cost optimization. By using Amazon API Gateway, we can handle incoming requests efficiently and distribute them to the appropriate Lambda functions. Amazon DynamoDB with On-Demand capacity mode allows us to handle unpredictable application traffic without worrying about provisioning capacity upfront. Provisioned Concurrency in Lambda ensures that a certain number of instances are always available to serve requests quickly. If there\\'s any need for asynchronous processing, message queues like Amazon SNS or Amazon SQS can be used.\\n\\n  3. **AWS Services:**\\n     - Amazon API Gateway\\n     - Amazon DynamoDB\\n     - AWS Lambda\\n     - Amazon SNS or Amazon SQS (optional)\\n\\n  4. **AWS Only:**\\n     This proposed solution relies solely on AWS services mentioned above.\\n\\n  5. **No External Knowledge:**\\n     The decision is based on the context provided and the AWS Well-Architected Framework principles, specifically focusing on performance efficiency and cost optimization. No external knowledge beyond the context was required to make this decision.'}]"
