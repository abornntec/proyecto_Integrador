    "As mentioned in the previous progress there were problems with the necesary compute power for running the models in our local machines and a exploration of using a Cloud solution was done. After doing some research we have decided to implement Vertex AI leveraging GCP, this will allow to test Mistral and Llama models without worrying about the compute resources in our local using the managed endpoints available as part of the solution.\n",
    "With the managed endpoints we will be able to call the models running in GCP and only pay for the requests made, as we are new users of GCP a 300 USD voucher was generated to us which will make the usage of the models free, however if this does not work the charge for the models is extremly low for the POC purpose of the project. After a succesfull implementation of a RAG system the company will need to perform and evaluation on what is the best way to host the models."
