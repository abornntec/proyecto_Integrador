    "Having structured and explored our data, the next crucial step is to prepare it for our Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. This involves applying targeted preprocessing techniques informed by the findings of our Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The goal of these actions is to refine the text, making it more suitable for generating high-quality embeddings and ultimately enhancing the performance of our RAG model. Following these preprocessing steps, we will proceed to create the embeddings and load them into a vector database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following specific actions have been identified and will be performed in this notebook before the embedding and loading phase, which will occur at the conclusion of this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Apply Text Normalization and Clean Unusal Characters:** Standardize the text by removing html characters and setting all to lower case.\n",
    "2.  **Handle \"data\" Word and repetitive words:** As data is very frequent in the context, we will consider it as a stopword for the beginig, if this does not help the method later we will be able to evaluate how to threat this sceario.\n",
    "3.  **Handle Repetitive Phrases:** Identify and process or remove frequently recurring phrases that may not contribute significant semantic value."
